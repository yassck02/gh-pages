*This Website :)*

This single page web app is used to display my projects, contact information, and resume.

### How it works
A .txt file containing a list of all my projects (their repo names) is stored in the assets folder for this website.
The README in the root of each project's repo is retrieved as HTML via the Github API
The retrieved html is then bound to the innerHTML tag on a div on this page rendering it to the screen
